# mydotfiles
all of my dot files

## place vimrc
Install and run `python3 set_vim.py` to install vim plugins.
Do this if you are setting vim or neovim manually.

## place zshrc
Install and run `python3 set_zsh.py` to install zsh plugins.
Before that, you might need oh-my-zsh installed.

## place tmux
Install and run `python3 set_tmux.py` to install tmux plugins.

## custome nvim
I am fan of LazyVim.
